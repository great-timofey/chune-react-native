        <FAQQuestion>
          Are there going to more features when the site releases?
        </FAQQuestion>
        <FAQAnswer>
          The main feature we plan on adding for the release of the site is the
          integration of Spotify and Apple Music. When one of your favorite
          artists releases a new song or album, it will show up on your feed and
          you will be able to play that music straight from the feed.
